### To learn how to play, run the game and find out! Bitch!

### **Game is now in a stable state, please report any bugs found on github issues**

### whats missing:
- checking for more bugs
- VS bot
- online multiplayer
- quickmatch? (probably wont do this)
## known bugs:
- Happened only once, bricks in endgame phase cant move if they dont have any possible midgame moves. (this bug should be fixed but it did happen again for some odd reason)

is the code good? probably not. does it work? yes.
