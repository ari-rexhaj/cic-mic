### **Game is now in a stable state, please report any bugs found on github issues**

### To learn how to play, run the game and find out! Bitch!

### whats missing:
- alot of testing for bugs
- VS bot
- online multiplayer
- quickmatch? (probably wont do this)
- adjusting the map lines so they ACTUALLY line up (would rather shoot myself tbh)
## known bugs:
- NONE!! is this a good thing or a bad thing?
